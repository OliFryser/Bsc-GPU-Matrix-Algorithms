\section{Limiting Factors of the GPU}

In order to write code that is accelerated by the GPU, we must know which overheads are involved and how they impact performance. 
For this we have measured the performance of the following metrics: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Allocating and freeing memory on the GPU
    \item Copying memory to and from the GPU
    \item Launching more blocks for each kernel
    \item Spawning more threads per block
\end{itemize}
